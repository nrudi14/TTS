    <p>I grew up in the the suburbs of Philadelphia and have a strong connection to the city. I spent my summers at the Jersey shore on an island town called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon,_New_Jersey" target="_blank">Avalon</a>. I went to University of Miami and Boston University for a degree in Business Management with a concentration in Finance. Since I was 19 I've suffered from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia"target="_blank">Fibromyalgia</a> and Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome which causes chronic pain and fatigue as well as limits my mobility. I've done a lot of traveling in Europe starting when I was very young and have visited most of Western and some of Eastern Europe.</p>

    <h2>I grew up playing every sport I could sign up for and even though I can't participate in them anymore due to my health I'm still a big sports fan. My favorite sport is ice hockey and my team is the <a href="http://www.philadelphiaflyers.com" target="_blank">Philadelphia Flyers</a>. I also follow cycling and the enjoy watching the Tour de France every July.
